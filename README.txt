VPoints is a points game analysis tool (DEPRECATED).

Features include moves tree (viewing and handling multiple game branching),
possibilities for editing, commenting the game,
opening and saving the game with 3 different file formats.


It is DEPRECATED.
It was developed on Delphi (which sucks and costs money),
requires Windows to do development and is a mess in the code.

It still can be launched and people sometimes use it, so I keep the repo for history.
